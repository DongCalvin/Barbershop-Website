      <h1 style="color: black">Our Story</h1>
      <p>Barber House began its journey in 1972, founded by Frank Doe, a passionate barber with a vision to create a welcoming space for men to elevate their look and confidence.</p>
      <p>Barber House's journey began in 1972 as "Frank's Barber Shop," a local favorite known for classic cuts and Frank Doe's signature shaves. In 2000, John Doe, Frank's grandson, took the reins and modernized the business as "Barber House." Michael expanded services, embraced high-quality products, and prioritized barber education. Today, Barber House thrives as a community cornerstone, offering a range of styles in a welcoming environment, all while staying true to its roots of exceptional service and customer confidence.</p>
